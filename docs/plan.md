the price, rating, and relevant tags.

region, avg. rating (highest to lowest & lowest to highest), price (highest to lowest & lowest to highest), tags, etc.

## Collaborative Planning

Allow for users to leave ratings on places they previously visited.
- Only after they went to that place through our website.

Each user should have a profile page that others can visit.

achievements, (TBD).

## Plane Tickets, Hotels, Car Rentals, Public Transportation*, Experiences*, Dining

### Details
The website should offer the user all of the following: 
Plane Tickets, Hotels, Car Rentals, Public Transportation*, Experiences*, Dining
- Public Transportation -> unlimited passes, one-way & two-way tickets for trains, etc.
- Experiences -> for now should be the most popular spots we can find.
    - Users should be allowed to recommend places via a form that would be submitted to the devs and then review to be implemented into the site.

## Accounts

### Details
User should be forced to make an account when they want to add to their cart and make a purchase from their solo cart. 

## Split Purchase

### Details
The person that created the live cart shall be classified as the creator of it and make the decision of how to pay for the cart.
- The people with guest privalleges in the cart shouldn't be allowed to add to the cart, but allowed to pay their share as designated by the creator.
- Allow the user to split the payments however they want.
    - A slide bar for the amount to pay (like how you tip at texas roadhouse on the kiosk). The percentage you assign to someone would subtract from the total amount.
